    </header><p>Harry is the main protagonist. He is orphaned as a baby when his parents, James and Lily Potter, are killed by Voldemort for resisting his attempted takeover of the wizarding world. As a final act of love, Lily protected Harry from Voldemort's curse, an act which saved his life but left him with a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead.
        When he arrives at Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House. The events leading up to the Second Wizard War require him to constantly get into trouble with various authority figures, a trait he inherited from his father. Over the next seven years, he learns more about his parents', grows into an accomplished wizard, and defeats Voldemort.
        Ron Weasley: Ron, also a Gryffindor, is the first classmate Harry befriends. He is one of six kids to Molly and Arthur Weasley. Ron struggles with self-esteem, thinking himself not as smart as others or as lucky. While he doesn't have a passion for learning, he nevertheless ends the series with very high marks, showing his aptitude. The epilogue shows he married Hermione
        Hermione Granger: The reasonable and logical third of the main characters, Hermione is an exceptional witch who befriends Harry and Ron on the first trip to Hogwarts. A Gryffindor, Hermione begins the series obsessed with following the rules no matter what. However, her friendship with Ron and Harry shows her she can relax, and she becomes integral to various plots as her knowledge of magic is unmatched by her peers. The epilogue shows she has two children with Ron.  </p>
